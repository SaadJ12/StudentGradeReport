# StudentGradeReport
 This project is my final project for the 1st semester, where I have developed a student grade report program in C++. The program allows users to manage and calculate grades for a group of students. It provides features such as input validation, grade calculations based on predefined criteria, and generating a comprehensive report.

Key Features:

Input validation for accurate data entry
Calculation of grades based on predefined criteria
Generation of a report with student names, grades, and final grades
Additional functionalities like sorting grades, calculating class averages, and generating a histogram of grades (optional)
